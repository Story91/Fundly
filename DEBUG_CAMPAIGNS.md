# 🔍 Debug Campaign Loading Issue

## ❌ **Problem:**
- Created 10+ campaigns on blockchain
- Frontend shows only mock data
- Real campaigns not loading

## 🎯 **Root Causes:**

### **1. Connection Issue**
- CampaignManager needs wallet connection to read from contract
- User might not be connected when page loads
- chainId might be undefined

### **2. Wrong Campaign ID**
- CreateCampaignButton uses hardcoded `blockchainId: 1`
- Real campaign IDs in smart contract start from 1, 2, 3...
- But we're always syncing as ID 1

### **3. Contract Reading**
- `campaignCount` might return 0
- `getCampaign` function might fail
- Contract address might be wrong

## 🔧 **Debug Steps Added:**

### **Check Console for these logs:**
```javascript
🔍 CampaignManager Debug:
chainId: 84532
contract address: 0xdEEd47D0b073B1dEF70813FFA1D6E9ac1Df0E3EF
totalCampaigns: 10
totalCampaigns type: bigint
totalCampaigns number: 10

🔍 App.js Campaign Data Debug:
campaignData.loading: false
campaignData.campaigns: []
campaignData.campaigns.length: 0
✅ Using campaigns: MOCK DATA
```

## 🎯 **Expected Fixes:**

### **1. Connect Wallet First**
- Sign in with Base Account
- Ensure you're on Base Sepolia (84532)
- Wait for connection before checking campaigns

### **2. Force Refresh**
- Refresh page after wallet connection
- Or click refresh button if available

### **3. Check Contract State**
- Verify campaigns exist in smart contract
- Check if `campaignCount` returns correct number

## 🧪 **Test Protocol:**

1. Open localhost:3000
2. Open DevTools Console
3. Sign in with Base Account
4. Look for debug logs
5. Check if totalCampaigns > 0
6. If yes but campaigns.length = 0, there's a reading issue
7. If totalCampaigns = 0, campaigns might not be saved properly

## 🚀 **Quick Fix if Debug Shows Issues:**

### **If totalCampaigns = 0:**
- Campaigns not saved to contract properly
- Check transaction hashes on BaseScan

### **If totalCampaigns > 0 but campaigns = []:**
- getCampaign function failing
- Check ABI compatibility
- Check contract address

### **If chainId = undefined:**
- Wallet not connected
- Wrong network
- Base Account connection issue
